Welcome to Arcanum

This game is loosly based on the Arcanum RPG with heavy modification in game mechanics 
in order to be used in a MUD environment. Other modifications have been made to include 
some pieces of Palladium RPG, Symbaroum, Salvage Worlds, and Fantasy HERO.

We have choses to go classless and leveless. You will be able to increase your ability
scores, buy skills and spells with the experience you acquire throught your adventures.
A complete tutorial area has been created for you to learn the basics of the game. More
advanced information will come as needed and is always available through the 'help'
command in the game. 

Enjoy!
